# Hover and Click Detection Improvements for Zoom/Pan

## Overview
Improved the hover and click detection system in the F1 visualizer to work consistently across all zoom levels and pan positions. The previous implementation relied on cached screen coordinates that became inaccurate when zooming or panning.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real-time Coordinate Calculation
**Problem**: The original `findDriverHitAt()` method used pre-calculated screen coordinates stored in the `carPositions` Map, which became outdated when zooming or panning.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the method to calculate coordinates on-the-fly:
- Converts canvas coordinates to world coordinates
- Recalculates driver positions in real-time based on current zoom and pan
- Ensures accurate hit detection regardless of view transformation

### 2. Tooltip Position Updates
**Problem**: Locked tooltips would remain in fixed screen positions when zooming or panning, losing their connection to the associated driver.

**Solution**: Added `updateLockedTooltipPosition()` method that:
- Tracks the current screen position of locked drivers
- Updates tooltip coordinates automatically during zoom/pan operations
- Maintains visual connection between tooltip and driver

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback
**Improvements**:
- **Cursor Changes**: Pointer cursor when hovering over drivers, grab/grabbing for pan operations
- **Debug Visualization**: Press 'h' to toggle hover detection areas (yellow dashed circles for number detection, cyan circles for car body detection, red crosshairs for car centers)
- **Performance Optimization**: Added debounced hover checking to reduce unnecessary calculations during rapid mouse movement

### 4. Improved Detection Areas
**Features**:
- Dual detection zones: precise circle detection for driver numbers, broader area for car bodies
- Zoom-adaptive detection radii that scale with zoom level
- Priority system that prefers driver number circle hits over car body hits

## Technical Implementation

### Core Methods Modified

#### `findDriverHitAt(canvasX, canvasY)`
- Now recalculates all driver positions in real-time
- Uses current zoom and pan values for accurate coordinate transformation
- Implements distance-based priority system for overlapping detection areas

#### `updateLockedTooltipPosition()`
- Tracks locked driver's current screen position
- Updates tooltip coordinates during zoom/pan operations
- Maintains proper visual offset from driver position

#### `debouncedHoverCheck()`
- Debounces hover detection to ~60fps for better performance
- Reduces computational overhead during rapid mouse movement
- Maintains responsive feel while optimizing performance

### Event Handler Enhancements

#### Zoom Operations
- All zoom methods (`zoomIn()`, `zoomOut()`, `resetZoom()`, wheel zoom) now call `updateLockedTooltipPosition()`
- Ensures tooltips remain properly positioned after zoom changes

#### Pan Operations
- Mousemove event during dragging updates locked tooltip positions
- Maintains tooltip connection to drivers while panning

#### Cursor Management
- Dynamic cursor changes based on hover state and interaction mode
- Visual feedback for interactive vs. navigation modes

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Hover Detection**: Move mouse over any driver car or number circle to see tooltip
2. **Click to Lock**: Click on a driver's number circle to lock the tooltip in place
3. **Unlock**: Click the same driver again or click elsewhere to unlock
4. **Debug Mode**: Press 'h' key to toggle hover detection visualization
5. **Zoom/Pan**: Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan - tooltips will follow drivers automatically

### For Developers
1. **Debug Visualization**: The `showHoverDebug` flag enables visual debugging of hit detection areas
2. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust the debounce timeout (currently 16ms) in `debouncedHoverCheck()` for different performance characteristics
3. **Detection Sensitivity**: Modify the `detectionRadius` calculation in `findDriverHitAt()` to adjust hover sensitivity

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Hover and click detection works consistently at any zoom level
2. **User Experience**: Tooltips maintain proper positioning relative to drivers
3. **Performance**: Debounced hover checking reduces unnecessary calculations
4. **Feedback**: Clear visual and cursor feedback for interactive elements
5. **Debugging**: Built-in visualization tools for troubleshooting hover issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test hover detection at minimum zoom (0.1x) and maximum zoom (5x)
2. Verify tooltip positioning remains accurate while panning
3. Test click-to-lock functionality with various zoom/pan combinations
4. Verify performance during rapid mouse movement
5. Test debug visualization mode for proper hit area display

The improvements ensure that the F1 visualizer provides consistent and accurate interaction regardless of the current view state, significantly enhancing the user experience when exploring race data at different zoom levels.
